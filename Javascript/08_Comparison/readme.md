Operator 
---------

- In JavaScript, an operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands, such as variables or values, and returns a result. 

- E:g : 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands, and + is called the operator.


Comparison Operator 
--------------------
- The comparison operators in JavaScript compare two variables or values and return a boolean value, either true or false based on comparison result.

- The comparison operators are used in logical expressions. A logical expression is evaluated to either true or false.

A. If the string contains only numeric value, it is converted to number type.

B. If the string contains non-numeric values as well, it will be converted to NaN.

C. If string is empty, it is converted to zero.

1. `==`	Equal	   
2. `!=`	Not Equal
3. `===`	Strict equality (equal value and equal type)
4. `!==`	Strict inequality (not equal value or not equal type)
5. `>`	Greater than 	
6. `<`	Less than   
7. `>=`	Greater than or Equal to
9. `<=`   Less than or Equal to
